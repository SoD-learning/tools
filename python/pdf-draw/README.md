# PDF Drawing Application

## Overview

This is a work-in-progress desktop application that allows teachers to open, annotate, and save PDF files. With a feature-rich drawing toolset, users can make various annotations directly on the PDF and save the modified PDF for future reference. The application is being developed using Python and integrates several libraries for GUI creation and PDF manipulation.

## Current Status: Work in Progress ðŸš§

The project is currently in the development phase. Essential features like opening PDFs, basic drawing capabilities, and saving files are under active development. Advanced features such as a variety of drawing tools, undo/redo capabilities, and performance optimisations are on the roadmap and will follow initial releases.

## Features (Planned and In Progress)

- Load and display PDF documents within the application.
- Annotate PDFs with various drawing tools:
  - Freehand drawing
  - Lines, shapes, and text
  - Color picker for annotations
  - Adjustable brush sizes
- Save the modified PDF as a new file, preserving the original document.
- Undo/Redo functionality for all annotations.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Cross-platform support for major operating systems (planned).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **Tkinter/PyQt**: For creating the application's graphical user interface.
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: A Python library used for PDF file manipulation.
- **unittest/pytest**: Used for testing the application to ensure reliability and stability.
